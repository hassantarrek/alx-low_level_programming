PLEASE NOTE:
for all people who working in alx may read this if he checks about anything
- ive copied the _strlen function an _strcpy function from past projects
- first i tried to make every function in a separeted file but i came up with some problems so i decided to copy them in the same
file for the task
- PLease note that ive got the inspirtion about putting the functions in the same file from a peer
- i felt it may be looks like a cheating so decided to write these words to you
THANK YOU
